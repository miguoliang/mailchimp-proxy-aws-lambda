# Use API to subscribe to MailChimp

## Introduction

In AMP (Accelerated Mobile Page), the Embbed Form of MailChimp is invalid due to CORS (Cross Origin Resources Sharing). So I wrote this AWS Lambda Function by Python 3.7.

People can deploy the zip file to his AWS Lambda Service directly, the only need to do is setting environment variables.

## Contribute

Just Run *package.sh*. I recommend read it before you use it.
